   \pagestyle{normal}

%brand% is an embedded open source network-attached storage (NAS)
operating system based on FreeBSD and released under a
`2-clause BSD license <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause>`_.
A NAS has an operating system optimized for file storage and sharing.

%brand% provides a browser-based, graphical configuration interface.
The built-in networking protocols provide storage access to multiple
operating systems. A plugin system is provided for extending the
built-in features by installing additional software.


.. _New Features in |release|:

New Features in |release|
-------------------------

* The base operating system has been updated to FreeBSD 11-STABLE.
  This brings in many
  `significant features
  <https://www.freebsd.org/releases/11.0R/relnotes.html>`_,
  including important speed improvements for 40/100GigE networking.

* An updated version of ZFS includes new pool
  `Feature Flags,
  <http://open-zfs.org/wiki/Feature_Flags>`__,
  the *skein* and *SHA512* hash functions.

* The Ports version of SSH has been updated to 7.4p1 to address
  `CVE-2016-10012
  <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10012>`__.
  Please use the :file:`/usr/local/bin/ssh` and
  :file:`/usr/local/bin/sshd` binaries.

* Python has been updated to version 3.6.1.

* The :command:`sas3flash` firmware upgrade tool for
  LSI/Avago/Broadcom 9305-8i, 9305-16i, and 9305-24i host adapters has
  been updated to the latest version.

* The
  `Zerotier <https://www.zerotier.com/>`__
  distributed network hypervisor has been added.

* The
  `mrsas(4) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mrsas>`__
  driver is loaded by default for the Dell PERC H330, Dell PERC
  H730, and other controllers which are supported by both the
  `mrsas(4) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mrsas>`__
  and
  `mfi(4) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mfi>`__
  drivers.

* Drivers for PMC Adaptec host bus adapters have been added with the
  `pmspcv(4) driver
  <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pmspcv&manpath=FreeBSD+11.0-RELEASE+and+Ports>`_.

* The :ref:`installer <Performing the Installation>` can now be run
  through a serial port for systems without directly-connected
  keyboards or monitors.

* The :ref:`login dialog <quick_enter_root_pass_fig>` now has a link
  to try a preliminary version of the new
  `Angular-based <https://angular.io/>`__
  GUI. Click on :guilabel:`Demo our upcoming UI!` to try it.

* An option to save the encryption seed has been added to the
  :ref:`System` :guilabel:`Save Config` button.

* Email notices about available updates are only sent once instead of
  once per day.

* A new :ref:`Alert Services` section in
  :menuselection:`System --> Alert Services` makes it possible to send
  important alerts through external services, including
  `AWS-SNS <https://aws.amazon.com/sns/>`__,
  `Hipchat <https://www.hipchat.com/>`__,
  `InfluxDB <https://www.influxdata.com/>`__,
  `Slack <https://slack.com/>`__,
  `Mattermost <https://about.mattermost.com/>`__,
  `OpsGenie <https://www.opsgenie.com/>`__,

  and
  `VictorOps <https://victorops.com/>`__.

* Encrypted volumes now use the AES-256 cipher.

* An experimental :ref:`Active Directory`
  :guilabel:`Enable Monitoring` option has been added. When enabled,
  this restarts the Active Directory service after a temporary loss of
  communications with an Active Directory server. Previously, a loss
  of communications with the AD server would stop the Active Directory
  service, requiring a manual restart. At present, this experimental
  feature is recommended only for testing in non-production
  environments. Please submit bug reports at
  `<https://bugs.freenas.org>`__
  if any problems are encountered.

* An enhanced :ref:`Services` screen adds a checkbox to directly set
  which services start at boot.

* Plugin and jail templates have been updated to address
  `CVE-2016-2107
  <https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-16:17.openssl.asc>`__.

* A new :ref:`VMs` (Virtual Machines) feature has been added. Based on
  `bhyve(8) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bhyve>`__,
  it offers support for BSDs (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD), Linux
  (including CentOS, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Ubuntu), SmartOS,
  Windows, and Windows Server. Future versions will include additional
  features like VM templates, hardware pass-through, and UEFI screen
  resolution adjustment.

* Netatalk has been updated to version
  `3.1.11
  <http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/3.1/ReleaseNotes3.1.11.html>`__.

* Samba has been updated to version
  `4.6.5
  <https://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-4.6.5.html>`__.

* The new :ref:`S3` service has been added, allowing the %brand%
  system to provide S3 file sharing.

* The Mosh
  `mobile shell <https://mosh.org/>`__
  has been added.

* Pipe Viewer, a
  `utility for monitoring the progress of data through a pipeline
  <http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml>`_,
  has been added. This can be useful for monitoring
  :command:`zfs send | zfs recv` commands.

* The Unison
  `file synchronization tool
  <http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/>`__
  has been added.

* The :ref:`Alert` about mismatching driver and firmware versions for
  Avago disk controllers has been removed as unnecessary. Driver and
  firmware versions no longer correspond.


.. _Changes Since |release|:

Changes Since |release|
-----------------------

%brand% uses a "rolling release" model instead of point releases. The
:ref:`Update` mechanism makes it easy to keep up-to-date with the
latest security fixes, bug fixes, and new features. Some updates
affect the user interface, so this section lists any functional
changes that have occurred since |release| was released.

.. note:: The screenshots in this documentation assume that the system
   has been fully updated to the latest STABLE version of %brand%
   |version|. If a screen on the system is not the same as shown in
   this guide, make sure that all updates have been applied.

U1
~~

* The :guilabel:`Read only` checkbox has been removed from
  :menuselection:`Jails --> Templates --> Add Jail Templates`.

* The NT4 option has been removed from :ref:`Directory Services` as it
  is no longer supported by Samba.

U2
~~

* Samba has been updated to `4.6.6
  <https://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-4.6.6.html>`__ to address
  `CVE-2017-11103
  <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11103>`__.

* The system has been patched to address `FreeBSD-SA-17:05.heimdal
  <https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-17:05.heimdal.asc>`__.

* The :ref:`Active Directory` :guilabel:`Enable Monitoring` option is no
  longer considered experimental.

.. index:: Hardware Recommendations
.. _Hardware Recommendations:

Hardware Recommendations
------------------------

%brand% |release| is based on FreeBSD 11 and supports the same
hardware found in the
`FreeBSD Hardware Compatibility List
<http://www.freebsd.org/releases/11.0R/hardware.html>`__.
Supported processors are listed in section
`2.1 amd64
<https://www.freebsd.org/releases/11.0R/hardware.html#proc>`_.
%brand% is only available for 64-bit processors. This architecture is
called *amd64* by AMD and *Intel 64* by Intel.

.. note:: %brand% boots from a GPT partition. This means that the
   system BIOS must be able to boot using either the legacy BIOS
   firmware interface or EFI.

Actual hardware requirements vary depending on the usage of the
%brand% system. This section provides some starter guidelines. The
`FreeNAS® Hardware Forum
<https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?forums/hardware.18/>`_
has performance tips from %brand% users and is a place to post
questions regarding the hardware best suited to meet specific
requirements.
`Hardware Recommendations
<https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?resources/hardware-recommendations-guide.12/>`__
gives detailed recommendations for system components, with the
`FreeNAS® Quick Hardware Guide
<https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?resources/freenas-quick-hardware-guide.7>`__
providing short lists of components for various configurations.
`Building, Burn-In, and Testing your FreeNAS® system
<https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/building-burn-in-and-testing-your-freenas-system.17750/>`_
has detailed instructions on testing new hardware.


.. _RAM:

RAM
~~~

The best way to get the most out of a %brand% system is to install
as much RAM as possible. The recommended minimum is 8 GB of RAM. The
more RAM, the better the performance, and the
`FreeNAS® Forums <https://forums.freenas.org/index.php>`_
provide anecdotal evidence from users on how much performance is
gained by adding more RAM.

Depending upon the use case, your system may require more RAM. Here
are some general rules of thumb:

* To use Active Directory with many users, add an additional 2 GB of
  RAM for winbind's internal cache.

* For iSCSI, install at least 16 GB of RAM if performance is not
  critical, or at least 32 GB of RAM if good performance is a
  requirement.

* When installing %brand% on a headless system, disable the shared
  memory settings for the video card in the BIOS.

* To use ZFS deduplication, ensure the system has at least 5 GB of RAM
  per TB of storage to be deduplicated.


If the hardware supports it and the budget allows for it, install ECC
RAM. While more expensive, ECC RAM is highly recommended as it
prevents in-flight corruption of data before the error-correcting
properties of ZFS come into play, thus providing consistency for the
checksumming and parity calculations performed by ZFS. If you consider
your data important, use ECC RAM. This
`Case Study
<http://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/zfs-corruption-fast10.pdf>`_
describes the risks associated with memory corruption.

Unless the system has at least 8 GB of RAM, consider adding RAM before
using %brand% to store data. Many users expect %brand% to function
with less memory, just at reduced performance.  The bottom line is
that these minimums are based on feedback from many users. Requests
for help in the forums or IRC are sometimes ignored when the installed
system does not have at least 8 GB of RAM because of the abundance of
information that %brand% may not behave properly with less memory.


.. _The Operating System Device:

The Operating System Device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The %brand% operating system is installed to at least one device that
is separate from the storage disks. The device can be a USB stick,
SSD, compact flash, or DOM (Disk on Module). Installation to a hard
drive is discouraged as that drive is then not available for data
storage.

.. note:: To write the installation file to a USB stick, **two** USB
   ports are needed, each with an inserted USB device. One USB stick
   contains the installer.  The other USB stick is the destination for
   the %brand% installation. Take care to select the correct USB
   device for the %brand% installation. It is **not** possible to
   install %brand% onto the same USB stick containing the installer.
   After installation, remove the installer USB stick. It might also
   be necessary to adjust the BIOS configuration to boot from the new
   %brand% USB stick.

When determining the type and size of the target device where %brand%
will be installed, keep these points in mind:

- the *bare minimum* size is 8 GB. This provides room for the
  operating system and several boot environments. Since each update
  creates a boot environment, this is the *recommended* minimum. 32 GB
  provides room for more boot environments.

- if you plan to make your own boot environments, budget about 1 GB of
  storage per boot environment. Consider deleting older boot
  environments after making sure they are no longer needed. Boot
  environments can be created and deleted using
  :menuselection:`System --> Boot`.

- use quality, name-brand USB sticks, as ZFS will quickly reveal
  errors on cheap, poorly-made sticks.

- for a more reliable boot disk, use two identical devices and select
  them both during the installation. This will create a mirrored boot
  device.


.. _Storage Disks and Controllers:

Storage Disks and Controllers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Disk section
<http://www.freebsd.org/releases/11.0R/hardware.html#DISK>`_
of the FreeBSD Hardware List lists the supported disk controllers. In
addition, support for 3ware 6 Gbps RAID controllers has been added
along with the CLI utility :command:`tw_cli` for managing 3ware RAID
controllers.

%brand% supports hot pluggable drives. Using this feature requires
enabling AHCI in the BIOS.

Reliable disk alerting and immediate reporting of a failed drive can
be obtained by using an HBA such as an Avago MegaRAID controller or a
3Ware twa-compatible controller.

.. note:: Upgrading the firmware of Avago SAS HBAs to the latest
   version is recommended.

.. index:: Highpoint RAID

Some Highpoint RAID controllers do not support pass-through of
S.M.A.R.T. data or other disk information, potentially including disk
serial numbers. It is best to use a different disk controller with
%brand%.


.. index:: Dell PERC H330, Dell PERC H730

.. note:: The system is configured to prefer the
   `mrsas(4) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mrsas>`__
   driver for controller cards like the Dell PERC H330 and H730 which
   are supported by several drivers. Although not recommended, the
   `mfi(4) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mfi>`__
   driver can be used instead by removing the  loader
   :ref:`Tunable <Tunables>`: :literal:`hw.mfi.mrsas_enable` or
   setting the :guilabel:`Value` to *0*.


Suggestions for testing disks before adding them to a RAID array can
be found in this
`forum post
<https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/checking-new-hdds-in-raid.12082/#post-55936>`__.
Additionally, `badblocks <https://linux.die.net/man/8/badblocks>`_ is
installed with %brand% for testing disks.

If the budget allows optimization of the disk subsystem, consider the
read/write needs and RAID requirements:

* For steady, non-contiguous writes, use disks with low seek times.
  Examples are 10K or 15K SAS drives which cost about $1/GB. An
  example configuration would be six 600 GB 15K SAS drives in a RAID
  10 which would yield 1.8 TB of usable space, or eight 600 GB 15K SAS
  drives in a RAID 10 which would yield 2.4 TB of usable space.

When high performance is a key requirement and budget permits,
consider a
`Fusion-I/O card <http://www.fusionio.com/products/>`_
which is optimized for massive random access. These cards are
expensive and are suited for high-end systems that demand performance.
A Fusion-I/O card can be formatted with a filesystem and used as
direct storage; when used this way, it does not have the write issues
typically associated with a flash device. A Fusion-I/O card can also
be used as a cache device when your ZFS dataset size is bigger than
your RAM. Due to the increased throughput, systems running these cards
typically use multiple 10 GigE network interfaces.

For ZFS,
`Disk Space Requirements for ZFS Storage Pools
<http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19253-01/819-5461/6n7ht6r12/index.html>`_
recommends a minimum of 16 GB of disk space. Due to the way that ZFS
creates swap,
**it is not possible to format less than 3 GB of space with ZFS**.
However, on a drive that is below the minimum recommended size, a fair
amount of storage space is lost to swap: for example, on a 4 GB
drive, 2 GB will be reserved for swap.

Users new to ZFS who are purchasing hardware should read through
`ZFS Storage Pools Recommendations
<https://web.archive.org/web/20161028084224/http://www.solarisinternals.com/wiki/index.php/ZFS_Best_Practices_Guide#ZFS_Storage_Pools_Recommendations>`_
first.

ZFS *vdevs*, groups of disks that act like a single device, can be
created using disks of different sizes.  However, the capacity
available on each disk is limited to the same capacity as the smallest
disk in the group. For example, a vdev with one 2 TB and two 4 TB
disks will only be able to use 2 TB of space on each disk. In general,
use disks that are the same size for the best space usage and
performance.

The
`ZFS Drive Size and Cost Comparison spreadsheet
<https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/zfs-drive-size-and-cost-comparison-spreadsheet.38092/>`_
is available to compare usable space provided by different quantities
and sizes of disks.


.. _Network Interfaces:

Network Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Ethernet section
<http://www.freebsd.org/releases/11.0R/hardware.html#ethernet>`_
of the FreeBSD Hardware Notes indicates which interfaces are supported
by each driver. While many interfaces are supported, %brand% users
have seen the best performance from Intel and Chelsio interfaces, so
consider these brands when purchasing a new NIC. Realtek cards often
perform poorly under CPU load as interfaces with these chipsets do not
provide their own processors.

At a minimum, a GigE interface is recommended. While GigE interfaces
and switches are affordable for home use, modern disks can easily
saturate their 110 MB/s throughput. For higher network throughput,
multiple GigE cards can be bonded together using the LACP type of
:ref:`Link Aggregations`. The Ethernet switch must support LACP, which
means a more expensive managed switch is required.

When network performance is a requirement and there is some money to
spend, use 10 GigE interfaces and a managed switch. Managed switches
with support for LACP and jumbo frames are preferred, as both can be
used to increase network throughput. Refer to the
`10 Gig Networking Primer
<https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/10-gig-networking-primer.25749/>`_
for more information.

.. note:: At present, these are not supported: InfiniBand,
   FibreChannel over Ethernet, or wireless interfaces.

Both hardware and the type of shares can affect network performance.
On the same hardware, SMB is slower than FTP or NFS because Samba is
`single-threaded
<https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-Developers-Guide/architecture.html>`_.
So a fast CPU can help with SMB performance.

Wake on LAN (WOL) support depends on the FreeBSD driver for the
interface. If the driver supports WOL, it can be enabled using
`ifconfig(8) <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ifconfig>`_. To
determine if WOL is supported on a particular interface, use the
interface name with the following command. In this example, the
capabilities line indicates that WOL is supported for the *re0*
interface:

.. code-block:: none

 ifconfig -m re0
 re0: flags=8943<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> metric 0 mtu 1500
         options=42098<VLAN_MTU,VLAN_HWTAGGING,VLAN_HWCSUM,WOL_MAGIC,VLAN_HWTSO>
         capabilities=5399b<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_MTU,VLAN_HWTAGGING,VLAN_HWCSUM,TSO4,WOL_UCAST,WOL_MCAST, WOL_MAGIC,VLAN_HWFILTER,VLAN_H WTSO>


If WOL support is shown but not working for a particular interface,
create a bug report using the instructions in :ref:`Support`.


.. _Getting Started with ZFS:

Getting Started with ZFS
------------------------

Readers new to ZFS should take a moment to read the :ref:`ZFS Primer`.
