.. index:: Rail Kit Assembly

Rail Kit Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Mount the Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install a spring on the silver posts in the side of each rail. Open
the clamp latches on the ends of each rail. Place the rail in the rack
with the front end toward the front of the rack, aligning the pins on
both ends of the rail with the mounting holes in the rack. Swing the
clamp latch closed to hold the rail in place. Use two of the supplied
screws to secure the back end of the rail in place. Repeat the process
for the second rail.


.. _x10_rail_clamp:

   Rail Clamp Latch


Mount the Unit in the Rack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Caution: Two people are required to safely lift the chassis for rack
installation or removal.** Do not install drives until after the
chassis has been installed in the rack, and remove all drives before
removing the chassis from the rack.

Snap the black bezel mounting ears onto the metal X10 chassis ears.
Carefully place the X10 chassis onto the rails mounted in the rack.
Push the X10 chassis in until the ears are flush with the front of the
rack.  Use two of the supplied screws to secure each ear to the rack.


Install Drive Trays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array. Each drive tray has
a status LED which is blue when active or amber if a fault has
occurred.

Press the blue button to open the latch. Carefully slide the tray into
a drive bay until the left side of the latch touches the metal front
edge of the chassis, then gently swing the latch closed until it
clicks into place.

.. _x10_drivetray_load:

.. figure:: images/tn_x10es12_driveload.png

   Installing Drive Trays


Connect Expansion Shelves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to the installation instructions included with expansion
shelves for details on connecting them.


Connect Network Cables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: Network cables vary by configuration and are not included.
Please contact :ref:`iX Support <Contacting iXsystems>` with any
questions.

Connect network cables to the Ethernet ports and Out-of-Band (OOB)
management port before attempting to power on and configure the X10
for the the first time. **The Out-of-Band (OOB) management port on the
X10 must be connected to a shielded Ethernet cable.**


Connect Power Cords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If any %brand% expansion shelves are connected to the X10 array, power
them on first, then wait at least two minutes before connecting power
cables to the X10 array.  **Do not plug the power cords into a power
outlet yet.** Connect a power cord to the back of one power supply,
pressing it into the plastic clamp and pressing on the tab to lock it
in place. Repeat the process for the second power supply and cord.

.. _x10_power:
.. figure:: images/tn_x10es12_powerclip.png
   :width: 1.5in

   Power Cord Connection


After both power cords have been connected to the X10, they can be
plugged into power outlets. The X10 is configured to automatically
power on when connected to a power outlet. This design ensures that
the X10 comes back on when power is restored after a power failure.


Install Bezel (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included bezel is not required for operation. If desired, install
the bezel by aligning it with the pins on the bezel ears and pressing
it into place.


Discover Out-of-Band Management IP Address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a variety of ways to determine the IP address that is being
used by the X10 Out-of-Band management interface.


Preset
^^^^^^

If the system was preconfigured by iXsystems, the Out-of-Band
management interfaces have already been configured with the IP
addresses requested by the user.

Otherwise, the Out-of-Band management IP addresses are set by default
to static addresses:

Node 1: *192.168.100.100*, subnet mask *255.255.255.0*

Node 2 (if present): *192.168.100.101*, subnet mask *255.255.255.0*


DHCP
^^^^

If the Out-of-Band management IP address has been configured to be
assigned by DHCP, the IP address assigned by the DHCP server can be
determined by checking the local DHCP server logs for the MAC
addresses on the back panel of each X10 node, #11 on
:numref:`Figure %s <x10_back>`.

The local DHCP server can also be configured to provide a fixed IP
address for the X10 Out-of-Band management by using the MAC address.


.. _X10_Serial_Cable:

Serial Cable
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Out-of-Band management IP address can be identified or changed by
temporarily connecting the black USB serial cable to the
Out-of-Band serial port, #5 on
:numref:`Figure %s <x10_back>`.
Connect the USB end of the black cable to a laptop or desktop
computer running serial terminal software.


Do not use the serial port for any purpose except checking the initial
X10 Out-of-Band management IP address or setting that address to be
obtained by a different method.
**After use, disconnect the black USB serial cable from the X10.**


.. _X10_Out-of-Band Serial Terminal Communication Settings:

Out-of-Band Serial Terminal Communication Settings
..................................................

**Serial Port Device Names**

The name of the serial port varies with operating systems. These are
some typical examples:

  * Windows: :samp:`COM{4}`

  * macOS: :samp:`/dev/tty.usbserial{xynnn}`

  * FreeBSD: :samp:`/dev/cuaU{0}`

  * Linux: :samp:`/dev/ttyUSB{0}`


**Serial Port Communication Parameters**

Set the serial terminal program to use the appopriate port with these
parameters:

*38400 baud, 8 data bits, no stop bits, no parity, no flow control*


Log in to the serial console with:

Username: **sysadmin**

Password: **superuser**

The current Out-of-Band management IP address is displayed with:


.. code-block:: none

   ifconfig eth0 | grep 'inet addr'
         inet addr:10.20.1.227  Bcast:10.20.1.255  Mask:255.255.254.0


The current Out-of-Band network configuration settings are displayed
with:


.. code-block:: none

   ipmitool -H 127.0.0.1 -U admin -P admin lan print


The Out-of-Band management system can be set to obtain an IP address
from DHCP with:


.. code-block:: none

   ipmitool -H 127.0.0.1 -U admin -P admin lan set 1 ipsrc dhcp


The Out-of-Band management system can be set to use a static IP
address and netmask. This example shows setting the IP address to
*192.168.100.100* with a netmask of *255.255.255.0*:


.. code-block:: none

   ipmitool -H 127.0.0.1 -U admin -P admin lan set 1 ipsrc static
   ipmitool -H 127.0.0.1 -U admin -P admin lan set 1 ipaddr 192.168.100.10
   ipmitool -H 127.0.0.1 -U admin -P admin lan set 1 netmask 255.255.255.0


Log out of the Out-of-Band management system by typing :literal:`exit`
and pressing :kbd:`Enter`.

**After use, disconnect the black USB serial cable from the X10.**


Connect to the X10 Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


With IPMI
^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: An IPMI remote management utility must be installed on the
   laptop or desktop computer used to manage the X10 remotely, and the
   computer must have access to the same network as the X10. For
   FreeBSD, macOS, or Linux,
   `IPMItool <https://sourceforge.net/projects/ipmitool/>`__
   can be used. For Windows,
   `ipmiutil <http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/>`__
   is available.


When the Out-of-Band management IP address has been determined, the
X10 console is accessible through IPMI. In this example,
*192.168.100.100* is the IP address assigned to the Out-of-Band
management interface.


For computers using :command:`ipmitool` on FreeBSD, macOS, or Linux,
enter:


.. code-block:: none

   ipmitool -I lanplus -H 192.168.100.100 -U admin -a sol activate


For Windows computers with :command:`ipmiutil`, enter:


.. code-block:: none

   ipmiutil sol -N 192.168.100.100 -U admin -a


Enter **admin** for the password, and the X10 console is connected.


.. tip:: The Out-of-Band console password can be changed by
   temporarily connecting the black USB serial cable to the serial
   port, #5 on
   :numref:`Figure %s <x10_back>`,
   as described in
   :ref:`the serial cable connection instructions <X10_Serial_Cable>`.
   Then give this command to set the new password, shown as
   *newpassword* in this example:

   .. code-block:: none

      ipmitool -H 127.0.0.1 -U admin -P admin user set password 2 newpassword


   **After use, disconnect the black USB serial cable from the
   X10.**


Proceed to :ref:`Using the X10 Console`.


With the Serial Cable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The X10 console can be directly connected to a serial terminal program
by temporarily disconnecting the gray serial cable from the system
console serial port, #10 on
:numref:`Figure %s <x10_back>`,
and temporarily connecting the black USB serial cable to that port.

Connect the USB end of the black USB serial cable to a laptop or
desktop computer running serial terminal software. See
:ref:`X10_Out-of-Band Serial Terminal Communication Settings` for the
serial device name. Set the terminal software to:

*115200 baud, 8 data bits, no stop bits, no parity, no flow control*


Wait two minutes after the X10 has been connected to power, then press
:kbd:`Enter` to display the console menu. Find the message starting
with :literal:`The web user interface is at:` and write down the IP
address shown. **After viewing the X10 console, disconnect the black
USB serial cable and reconnect the gray System Management cable**
to the system serial console port, #10 on
:numref:`Figure %s <x10_back>`.

.. _Using the X10 Console:

Using the X10 Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The X10 console has two modes: SES (SCSI Enclosure Services) mode, and
the standard x86 console mode.

If :literal:`ESM A =>` is displayed, the X10 is in SES mode.
Switch to the X86 console mode by typing these characters:
:literal:`$%^0`


The normal x86 console is displayed.


.. note:: The SES console can be displayed again by typing these
   characters: :literal:`$%^2`


Perform %brand% Initial Software Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The console displays the IP address of the %brand% X10 graphical web
interface, *192.168.100.231* in this example:


.. code-block:: none

   The web user interface is at:

   http://192.168.100.231


Enter the IP address into a browser on a computer on the same network
to access the web user interface.
